ðŸ‘‹Hello, this is the source code for my personal website, [ree.ink](https://ree.ink).

## Building

To build the website, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Recommended v18.15.0) and pnpm (v8.x) installed. Then, run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev

# Build the website
pnpm build

# Preview the built website
pnpm preview
```
